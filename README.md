# Python

This is a collection of all of my Python projects. All the projects are available in this repository as pdf versions of a Python's Jupyter notebook, while  a brief description of all them is listed in the README file.

Project 1. To start I've done a project through DataCamp's Python Intermediate course. In particular, it is a simulation of a Random Walk that rapresents a Stochastic event: climbing at least 60 steir steps throwing a die 100 times (following certain rules). The odds of whether this is possible or not are calculated in a rough way, simulating this random process 10.000 times and checking how many times the 'mission' has succeded. A plot of the random walks and a histogram showing the final step in each 'try' are shown using Matplotlib library, while the other analysis is done using Numpy package.
